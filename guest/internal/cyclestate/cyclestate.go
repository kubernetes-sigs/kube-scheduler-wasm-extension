// Package cyclestate holds fields scoped to the Pod Scheduling context, e.g.
// the beginning of the scheduling cycle until the end of the binding cycle.
//
// This field is reset on prefilter.Plugin, as that begins a new scheduling
// cycle. Even if the pod is the same as a failed cycle, its state must be
// reset so that any change is visible to the guest plugin.
